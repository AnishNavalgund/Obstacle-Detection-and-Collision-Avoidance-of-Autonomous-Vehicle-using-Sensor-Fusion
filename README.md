# Obstacle-Detection-and-Collision-Avoidance-of-Autonomous-Vehicle-using-Sensor-Fusion

In todayâ€™s world, AUTOMATION is fast growing and an interesting field. In automotive industry, the concept of Autonomous (Self-Driving) Car is taking over the world. Designers need to analyze various situations while designing autonomous cars. One such situation is when an obstacle is detected along the path of an autonomous car. This project deals with how an autonomous car handles itself from crashing into an obstacle which is present along its path.
